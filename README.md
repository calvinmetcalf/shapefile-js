# Shapefile.js

If you are having encoding issues in internet explorer please include [this script](https://cdn.rawgit.com/calvinmetcalf/text-encoding/4aff951959085f74a5872aeed8d79ec95b6c74c3/lib/encoding-indexes.js) as well.

Redoing all of this in modern JS. Promises, Typed Arrays, other hipster things, I wouldn't say it's based on [RandomEtc's version](https://github.com/RandomEtc/shapefile-js) as much as inspired by it as there is 0 code shared and I really only read the binary ajax part of his (hence why my function has the same name, they are otherwise not related). My sources were:

- [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile)
- [ESRI white paper](http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf)
- [This page on Xbase](http://www.clicketyclick.dk/databases/xbase/format/dbf.html)

## Demos

- [Countries/zipfile](http://calvinmetcalf.github.io/shapefile-js)
- [Google maps](http://calvinmetcalf.github.io/shapefile-js/site/map.html)
- [Local Zipfile](http://leaflet.calvinmetcalf.com)
- [Projected big with web workers](http://calvinmetcalf.github.io/shapefile-js/site/proj.html)
- [Projected small](http://calvinmetcalf.github.io/shapefile-js/site/proj-small.html)

## Usage

For use with [browserify](http://browserify.org/), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/):

    npm install shpjs --save
    
Or include directly in your webpage from:

    https://unpkg.com/shpjs@latest/dist/shp.js

## API

Has a function `shp` which accepts a string which is the path the she shapefile minus the extension and returns a promise which resolves into geojson.

```javascript
	//for the shapefiles in the folder called 'files' with the name pandr.shp
	shp("files/pandr").then(function(geojson){
		//do something with your geojson
	});
```
or you can call it on a .zip file which contains the shapefile

```javascript
	//for the shapefiles in the files folder called pandr.shp
	shp("files/pandr.zip").then(function(geojson){
		//see bellow for whats here this internally call shp.parseZip()
	});
```

or if you got the zip some other way (like the [File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)) then with the arrayBuffer you can call

```javascript
shp(buffer).then(function(geojson){});
//or
shp.parseZip(buffer)->returns zip
```
If there is only one shp in the zipefile it returns geojson, if there are multiple then it will be an array.  All of the geojson objects have an extra key `fileName` the value of which is the
name of the shapefile minus the extension (I.E. the part of the name that's the same for all of them)

You could also load the arraybuffers seperately:

```javascript
shp.combine([shp.parseShp(shpBuffer, /*optional prj str*/),shp.parseDbf(dbfBuffer)]);
```

If a row conversion function is specified as the third argument, the specified function is invoked for each row, being passed a geometry object representing the current row and the index starting at zero. If an object is returned, it will be used instead of the current one. This can be used for example to save simplified polygons to be able to load bigger files.

```javascript
function row(geometry, i) {
	if (i === 0 && geometry.type == 'Point') {
		return { type: 'Point', coordinates: [0, 0] };
	}
}

// Provide a row conversion function when loading the geojson from a path
shp("files/pandr", null, row).then(function(geojson){
	//do something with your manipulated geojson
});

// Provide a row conversion function when loading the shapes separately
shp.combine([shp.parseShp(shpBuffer, null, row),shp.parseDbf(dbfBuffer)]);
```


## Stick it in a worker

I used my library [catiline](http://catilinejs.com/) to parallelize the demos to do so I changed

```html
<script src='dist/shp.js'> </script>
<script>
	shp('files/shapeFile.zip').then(function(data){
		//do stuff with data
	});
</script>
```

to

```html
<script src='website/catiline.js'> </script>
<script>
	var worker = cw(function(base,cb){
		importScripts('dist/shp.js');
		shp(base).then(cb);
	});
	//worker can be called multiple times
	worker.data(cw.makeUrl('files/shapeFile.zip')).then(function(data){
		//do stuff with data
	});
</script>
```

to send the worker a buffer from the file api you'd do (I'm omitting where you include the catiline script)

```javascript
var worker = cw(function(data){
	importScripts('../dist/shp.js');
	return shp.parseZip(data);
});

worker.data(reader.result,[reader.result]).then(function(data){
	//do stuff with data
});
```

## Done

- Binary Ajax
- parsing the shp
- parse the dbf
- join em
- zip
- file api
- Some Projections
- More Projections

## to do

- check for geometry validity.
- Tests
